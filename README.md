# FRIDAY-Gizmos

Welcome to FRIDAY-Gizmos - an open-source library of toolkit for FRIDAY. Everyone is more than welcomed to contribute you tools to this repo. 

## About

FRIDAY-Gizmos aims to assemble a comprehensive collection of tools and resources to support various funcationality of FRIDAY. 

<!-- ## Getting Started

To get started with FRIDAY-Gizmos, simply clone the repository and explore the available tools. You can also contribute your own tools or improvements by following our contribution guidelines. -->

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all forms - whether it's adding new tools, fixing bugs, improving documentation, or sharing ideas.

If you're interested in contributing tools to our collection, it must meet the following requirements:
 <!-- please check out our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information. -->
1. The format should be consistent with the example tools:
    - You need to import required **Python packages**.
    - The **function name** should be consistent with the tool's **file name**.
    - The function should contain the tool's specific execution code, with **detailed description** and **explanations of input and output parameters**.
    
If the tool is generated by FRIDAY, rest assured, it automatically meets the above requirements.
2. The tool must be reusable. For example, if creating a new folder, the folder name should be written as a parameter rather than being hardcoded in the tool's code.

Here is an example of a tool:
```python
import os

def create_folder(working_directory, folder_name):
    """
    Create a folder under the specified working directory or the default working directory.

    Args:
    working_directory (str): The path of the working directory. If not provided, the default working directory will be used.
    folder_name (str): The name of the folder to be created. Default is 'myfold'.

    Returns:
    None
    """
    # Check if the working_directory is provided, if not, use the default working directory
    if working_directory:
        os.chdir(working_directory)

    # Create the folder
    os.makedirs(folder_name)
```
