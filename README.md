# FRIDAY-Gizmos

Welcome to FRIDAY-Gizmos - an open-source library of toolkit for FRIDAY. Everyone is more than welcomed to contribute you tools to this repo. 

## About

FRIDAY-Gizmos aims to assemble a comprehensive collection of tools and resources to support various funcationality of FRIDAY. 

<!-- ## Getting Started

To get started with FRIDAY-Gizmos, simply clone the repository and explore the available tools. You can also contribute your own tools or improvements by following our contribution guidelines. -->

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all forms - whether it's adding new tools, fixing bugs, improving documentation, or sharing ideas.

If you're interested in contributing tools to our collection, it must meet the following requirements:
 <!-- please check out our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information. -->
1. The format should be consistent with the example tools:
    - You need to import `from friday.action.base_action import BaseAction` and other required Python packages.
    - The class name should be consistent with the tool's file name.
    - The `__init__` function must contain self._description, briefly describing the specific functionality of the tool, which will be used for tool retrieval.
    - The `__call__` function should contain the tool's specific execution code, with detailed explanations of input and output parameters.
    - Finally, provide a usage example in the form of comments at the end. This example will assist FRIDAY in using the tool.
If the tool is generated by FRIDAY, rest assured, it automatically meets the above requirements.
2. The tool must be reusable. For example, if creating a new folder, the folder name should be written as a parameter rather than being hardcoded in the tool's code.

Here is an example of a tool:
```python
from friday.action.base_action import BaseAction
import os

class create_folder(BaseAction):
    def __init__(self):
        self._description = "Create a folder under the default working directory."

    def __call__(self, working_directory=None, folder_name='myfold', *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Create a folder under the specified working directory or the default working directory.

        Args:
        working_directory (str): The path of the working directory. If not provided, the default working directory will be used.
        folder_name (str): The name of the folder to be created. Default is 'myfold'.

        Returns:
        None
        """
        # Check if the working_directory is provided, if not, use the default working directory
        if working_directory:
            os.chdir(working_directory)

        # Create the folder
        os.makedirs(folder_name)

# Example of how to use the class
# create_folder_action = create_folder()
# create_folder_action(working_directory='/home/heroding/桌面/Jarvis/working_dir', folder_name='my_new_folder')
```
